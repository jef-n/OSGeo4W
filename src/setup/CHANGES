Version HEAD

 - Alert user when encountering a .tar file of unsupported format rather than
   silently failing to extract.  Also be more accepting of non-GNU tar formats,
   such as those created by libtar/cmake.

 - If running on 9x/ME versions of Windows, look for setup_legacy.ini/.bz2
   instead of setup.ini/.bz2, in support for future dropping of non-NT support
   and forking of the distro.

Version 2.573.2.2

 - Fix crash when trying to MD5 a non-existant package file that failed to
   download.

Version 2.573.2.1

 - Don't append a trailing slash to local package directory location if it
   already has one, or it ends in a backslash.

 - Be more robust in falling back to setup.ini if setup.bz2 doesn't exist
   or appears to be corrupt.

 - Fix crashes and improve specificity of error messages when encountering
   an .ini file parse error.  Make progress meter active during parsing of a
   bz2-compressed .ini file.

 - At the last install step, inform the user of success/failure at the bottom
   of the main panel instead of with an annoying message box popup.

 - Fix bug that caused a wrong version of a source package to be selected
   in some cases due to erroniously comparing versions as text instead of
   numerically.

 - Gracefully handle the case where two packages contain a postinstall script
   of the same name.

 - Allow interactively retrying to replace open files.

 - Create Cygwin.bat with upper-case C to make filename TAB completion of
   /cygdrive more convenient.

 - Fix unreadable chooser page due to bad background colour problem.

 - Make categories named with an initial "." default to expanded display.

 - Fix a class of crashes due to poor string handling.  Remove use of custom
   String class in favor of std::string.

 - Update DNS names to preferred forms: cygwin.com and sources.redhat.com.

 - Handle dropped mirrors elegantly.

 - Fix incorrect logging of postinstall script success/failure.

 - Provide indication of site that a file is being downloaded from.

 - Fix command line options to override cached selections.

 - Sort the mirrors list by logical structure of DNS names.

 - Do not attempt to reopen a missing package database on initial install.

 - Cache mirror list and use local copy if server unavailable.

 - Slightly improve logged error messages.

 - Run postinstall scripts in dependency order.

 - Fix problem of FTP connections timing out and not being retried.

 - Change checkbox label to "Hide obsolete packages" and add tooltip that
   explains in more detail what it does.

 - Set tooltip timeout delay to 30 seconds.

 - Fix problem of text and icons using white background instead of user's
   selected color.

Version 2.510.2.2

 - Recompile with gcc 3.3.3 as workaround until the STL crashes are
   investigated.

Version 2.510.2.1

 - Retrieve exit status of preremove/postinstall scripts.  Log abnormal exits.

 - Use /bin/bash rather than /bin/sh when running preremove/postinstall scripts
   to facilitate upgrading /bin/sh.

 - Remove support for undocumented and dangerous postremove scripts.

 - Add new "Size" column to package chooser.

 - Perform explicit dependency checking when the user finishes with the
   package selection step, and if any missing dependencies are found prompt
   to resolve the conflicts.

 - Checkbox option to hide packages in category ZZZRemovedPackages or any
   category that begins with '_'.  (Note: ZZZRemovedPackages has now been
   renamed to _obsolete on the mirrors.)  Packages in these categories are
   either empty placeholder packages that have been renamed/removed, or are
   infrastructure packages like 'update-info-dir' and are not generally useful
   to the end user.

 - Support mouse wheel scrolling in the package chooser.

 - Use graphical "+" and "-" symbols in category mode of the package chooser.

 - Improve painting method for the package chooser to improve redraw speed and
   prevent sluggish scrolling.

 - Fix unpacking of hardlinks in source packages.

 - Change ordering of uninstall actions so that all preremove scripts are
   executed prior to deleting files.  Fixes problem with "cannot find DLL"
   popup error messages during preremove scripts when lots of packages are
   upgraded at once.

 - Remove the --no-md5 (-5) command line option - the cache is now never
   fully MD5-ed, as to do so takes far too long, and packages will be checked
   before installation anyway.

 - Make the MD5 checks immediately prior to installing packages actually
   display notification in the GUI.

 - Add support for tooltips that appear when the mouse pointer hovers
   over controls.

 - Add text to dialogs recommending Binary mode and "All users".  Add clickable
   hyperlinks to the appropriate sections of the online Users Guide.

 - Fix some dialog elements that were not resized properly when the window was
   resized.

 - Include manifest, resulting in support for XP themes.

 - Remember proxy port setting.

 - Fix dependency calculation bug when switching between Curr/Prev/Exp radio
   buttons.

 - Fix crash on encountering a postinstall script with a name of 4
   characters or less.

 - Display only valid URL schemes in the mirrors list.

Version 2.457.2.2

 - Set CYGWIN=nontsec, for postinstall scripts.

 - Fix corrupt display of ini parse percentage in log file.

 - Filter the mirrors list to only URL schemes that setup can use.

Version 2.457.2.1

 - Fix setup keeping open handles to every tarball it installs during a run.
   (Which appears to have been indirectly responsible for the weird hangs
   people have been experiencing.)

 - Fix a miscellany of error-reporting deficiencies.

 - Close stdin, to protect against rogue postinstall scripts attempting to
   wait for user input.

Version 2.427

 - Last release before CHANGES file begun.
